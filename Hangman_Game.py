TASK 1: Hangman Game

Goal: Create a simple text-based Hangman game where the player guesses a word one letter at a time.

Simplified Scope: 
    ● Use a small list of 5 predefined words (no need to use a file or API). 
    ● Limit incorrect guesses to 6.
    ● Basic console input/output — no graphics or audio.

Key Concepts Used: random, while loop, if-else, strings, lists.
